## Overview

The N-Queens problem requires placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. This solver:

- Encodes the problem as a CNF formula.
- Uses an **incremental SAT solver** to enumerate all valid solutions.
- Supports **Glucose3**, **MiniSat**, or **CaDiCaL** as the backend SAT solver.

---

## Features

- Supports variable board sizes (\(N > 3\)).  
- Incrementally enumerates all possible solutions.  
- Optional visual representation of a solution.  
- Cross-verifies results against known small N solutions.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+  
- [PySAT](https://pysathq.github.io/) Python library

```bash
pip install python-sat[pblib,aiger]
